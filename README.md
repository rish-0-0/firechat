#Chat service only using firebase
Lol, let's see how this goes
### Steps to run it locally
`yarn`<br>
`yarn start`<br>

which you might need to get one yourself and initialize
the database, storage and etc. 
### Where to keep the firebase service key?
Put in the `src` directory where `App.js` file is present.
